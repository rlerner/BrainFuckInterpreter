# BrainFuckInterpreter
Brainfuck is, indeed, a language. You can find an interpreter for it in nearly every language, including in itself. A Turing-complete language, you can have a lot of fun with it, but you'll never find an actual application developed in it.

Anyways, I wanted to be able to run the programs, and I wanted to learn the language. The easiest way was to write an interpreter. So, here it is.

Yes, it has a bad word in the title. I'm sorry. It is a [real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) that I didn't name.

Wikipedia has the entire function list (which is eight individual constructs) if you'd like to learn it.
